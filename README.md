# Purpose
This desktop application is intended for the use of the executive board of the student organization, ALPFA Rutgers-Newark. It is meant to send attendence reports from virtual events that we have conducted via Zoom to validate who attended them. Participation to our events is crucial as it is one of the factors that contributes to our Point System (each student is awareded a specific amount of points if they participate in one of our events, assuming they're there 75% of its duration).
